### üîß Technical Problem-Solving Questions

#### "Tell me about a difficult technical problem you solved"
**Perfect Technical STAR Template:**
```
STARTER: "I can share a complex performance challenge I faced when building..."

SITUATION: "In my [project name], we were experiencing [specific technical problem - slow response times, memory issues, scaling problems]. The issue was [specific impact - user complaints, failed tests, production errors]."

TASK: "I needed to [specific technical goal - optimize performance, fix the bug, scale the system] without [constraints - disrupting users, breaking existing features, exceeding budget]."

ACTION: "I approached this systematically:
- First, I [investigation step - profiled the application, analyzed logs, reviewed metrics]
- I discovered that [root cause - inefficient queries, memory leaks, architecture bottleneck]
- I decided to [solution approach - implement caching, refactor code, redesign architecture] because [reasoning]

- I also [additional steps - added monitoring, wrote tests, documented the solution]"

RESULT: "The result was [specific improvement - 60% faster response times, 90% reduction in errors, handled 10x traffic]. This solution [lasting impact - is still running in production, became team standard, saved costs]. The experience taught me [key learning - importance of profiling, value of systematic debugging, need for monitoring]."
```

#### Sample Technical Problem Stories You Should Develop:
```

Scaling Challenge Story:
- System failing under traffic spikes
- Implemented load balancing, horizontal scaling, caching
- Result: Handled 50x traffic increase reliably

Bug Investigation Story:
- Intermittent production bug affecting users
- Systematic debugging, log analysis, root cause identification
- Result: Eliminated issue, improved monitoring, prevented similar bugs
```
