# Technical English Sentence Builder

## Purpose

This guide provides ready-to-use sentence templates for any technical situation. As someone who can build full-stack applications but struggles with English structure, these templates will become your safety net.

**Key Principle**: You don't need perfect grammar. You need clear, structured communication that demonstrates your technical knowledge.
