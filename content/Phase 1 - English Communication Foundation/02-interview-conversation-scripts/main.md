## Script 1: Introduction & Experience Discussion

### Real FAANG Interview Opening

**Interviewer**: "Hi! Thanks for joining me today. Can you start by telling me about yourself and your background?"

**Candidate Response Template**:
```
"Hi, thanks for having me! I'm a full-stack developer with [X years] of experience building web applications. I specialize in Next.js for frontend development and Express.js for backend APIs.

In my recent projects, I've built [type of application] that handles [specific functionality]. For example, I created a [specific project] where I used Next.js for the user interface, Express.js for the REST API, and [database] with [ORM] for data management. I deployed it to [platform] and it's currently serving [users/traffic].

What I enjoy most about development is solving complex problems and optimizing performance. I'm particularly interested in [specific area - like system architecture or user experience], which is why I'm excited about this role at [company name]."

## Script 2: Coding Problem Introduction

### Typical Coding Question Setup

**Interviewer**: "Great! Now let's move to a coding problem. I want you to solve this problem: [states problem]. Do you have any questions before you start?"

**Candidate Response Template**:
```
"Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. [Restate the problem in your own words]. 

Let me ask a few clarifying questions:
- What's the expected input size? Should I optimize for large datasets?
- Are there any constraints on time or space complexity?
- Should I handle edge cases like empty input or null values?
- Is there a preferred programming language, or can I use JavaScript?

[After getting answers]

Alright, let me think through this step by step. I'll start by explaining my approach, then code it up, and finally test it with some examples. Does that sound good?"
```

### Working Through the Problem

**Candidate Thought Process (Say out loud)**:
```
"Looking at this problem, I notice [specific pattern or characteristic]. This reminds me of [similar problem type or pattern].

My approach will be:
1. [First step with brief explanation]
2. [Second step with brief explanation]  
3. [Third step with brief explanation]

Let me start with a simple example to verify my understanding. If the input is [example], then [trace through expected output].

I think [specific algorithm/technique] would work well here because [reasoning]. The time complexity should be O([complexity]) and space complexity O([complexity]).

Let me start coding this up..."
```

**While Coding (Keep talking)**:
```
"I'll start by setting up the basic structure..."
"Here I'm initializing [variable] to track [purpose]..."
"This loop iterates through [data structure] to [purpose]..."
"I'm using this condition to check [specific case]..."
"Let me add a comment here to explain this logic..."
"Actually, let me trace through this with an example to make sure it works..."
```

### Testing Your Solution

**Candidate Testing Approach**:
```
"Now let me test this with a few examples:

For input [simple example]: [walk through code execution]
The output should be [expected result], and my code gives [actual result]. Good!

Let me try an edge case: [edge case example]
[Walk through execution]
This handles the edge case correctly.

The time complexity is O([complexity]) because [explanation].
The space complexity is O([complexity]) because [explanation].

I think this solution is correct. Are there any optimizations or edge cases you'd like me to consider?"
```

## Script 3: System Design Discussion

### System Design Question Opening

**Interviewer**: "Now let's move to system design. I'd like you to design a system like Twitter that can handle 100 million daily active users."

**Candidate Response Template**:
```
"Great! I'd love to design a Twitter-like system. Before I start drawing anything, let me ask some clarifying questions to make sure I understand the requirements correctly:

1. What are the core features? Should I focus on posting tweets, following users, and viewing timelines?
2. What's the scale we're targeting? You mentioned 100 million DAU - what's the read-to-write ratio?
3. Do we need real-time features like notifications, or is eventual consistency okay?
4. Should I consider additional features like direct messages or media uploads?
5. Are there any specific performance requirements I should optimize for?

[After getting answers]

Perfect. Let me approach this systematically. I'll start by:
1. Estimating the scale and calculating our capacity requirements
2. Designing the high-level architecture
3. Discussing the database design
4. Diving deep into the most challenging component
5. Addressing potential bottlenecks and scaling considerations

Does this approach work for you?"
```

### Walking Through Your Design

**Scale Estimation**:
```
"Let me work through the numbers:

With 100 million DAU, assuming each user posts 2 tweets per day on average:
- Write QPS: 100M users × 2 tweets ÷ 86,400 seconds ≈ 2,300 tweets per second
- Read QPS: If users check their timeline 10 times per day: 100M × 10 ÷ 86,400 ≈ 11,500 reads per second

For storage, assuming each tweet is about 200 bytes:
- Daily storage: 2,300 tweets/sec × 200 bytes × 86,400 sec ≈ 40 GB per day
- Annual storage: 40 GB × 365 ≈ 14.6 TB per year

These numbers tell me we need a distributed system with caching for the read-heavy workload."
```

**High-Level Architecture**:
```
"Let me draw the high-level architecture:

[Draw while explaining]
1. Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple API servers
2. API Gateway: Handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
3. Application Servers: Multiple instances of our Twitter service
4. Cache Layer: Redis for timeline caching and session storage
5. Database: PostgreSQL for user data and tweets, with read replicas
6. Message Queue: Kafka for async processing like timeline generation
7. File Storage: S3 for media uploads

The request flow goes: User → Load Balancer → API Gateway → App Server → Cache → Database"
```

**Deep Dive Example**:
```
"Let me dive deeper into the timeline generation, which is the most complex part.

There are two main approaches:
1. Fan-out-on-write (Push model): When user posts, immediately update all followers' cached timelines
2. Fan-out-on-read (Pull model): When user requests timeline, fetch latest tweets from everyone they follow

For celebrities with millions of followers, fan-out-on-write is too slow. For regular users, fan-out-on-read is too slow.

I recommend a hybrid approach:
- For users with < 1000 followers: Use fan-out-on-write
- For celebrities: Use fan-out-on-read
- Cache timelines in Redis with 5-minute TTL

This gives us fast reads for most users and manageable write performance for celebrities."
```

## Script 4: Behavioral Questions

### Leadership Principles (Amazon Style)

**Interviewer**: "Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly to solve a problem."

**STAR Method Response**:
```
"I can share a specific example from a recent project.

**Situation**: I was building a full-stack application for [purpose], and the client requested real-time chat functionality. I had never implemented WebSocket connections before, and the deadline was only two weeks away.

**Task**: I needed to learn WebSocket technology, implement real-time messaging, and integrate it with my existing Next.js and Express.js architecture without breaking the existing features.

**Action**: I broke down the learning process:
1. First day: I spent 4 hours reading documentation and watching tutorials about WebSockets and Socket.io
2. Second day: I built a simple chat prototype to understand the concepts
3. Days 3-5: I integrated Socket.io into my Express backend and connected it to my Next.js frontend
4. I encountered issues with authentication in WebSocket connections, so I researched JWT token handling in Socket.io
5. I tested the implementation thoroughly with multiple browser tabs to simulate real users

**Result**: I successfully delivered the real-time chat feature on time. The client was impressed with the smooth real-time experience. More importantly, I gained confidence in my ability to quickly learn new technologies. I've since used WebSockets in two other projects, and the learning experience made me more comfortable tackling unfamiliar technical challenges.

What I learned is that breaking down complex new technologies into small, manageable pieces makes them less intimidating and easier to master."
```

### Technical Challenge Story

**Interviewer**: "Describe a challenging technical problem you solved recently."

**Response Template**:
```
"I'd like to share a performance optimization challenge I faced.

**Situation**: In one of my Next.js applications, users were reporting very slow page loads, especially for the dashboard page. The page was taking 8-10 seconds to load, which was creating a poor user experience.

**Task**: I needed to identify the performance bottleneck and optimize the application to achieve sub-2-second load times.

**Action**: I approached this systematically:
1. I used Chrome DevTools to profile the application and found that the dashboard was making 12 separate API calls to my Express backend
2. I analyzed the Network tab and saw that these calls were happening sequentially, not in parallel
3. I examined my Express.js API endpoints and discovered that some database queries were missing indexes
4. I implemented several optimizations:
   - Combined multiple API calls into a single optimized endpoint
   - Added database indexes on frequently queried fields
   - Implemented React.memo for expensive components
   - Added loading states to improve perceived performance

**Result**: The dashboard load time dropped from 8-10 seconds to 1.5 seconds. User engagement increased by 40% based on analytics data. The optimization techniques I learned helped me proactively design better performance into subsequent projects.

This experience taught me the importance of performance monitoring and systematic debugging approaches."
```

## Script 5: Handling Difficult Questions

### When You Don't Know Something

**Interviewer**: "How would you implement distributed consensus in a microservices architecture?"

**Honest but Strategic Response**:
```
"I don't have direct experience implementing distributed consensus algorithms like Raft or PBFT, but I understand the general problem and can share my approach to learning it.

The core challenge is ensuring all services in a distributed system agree on shared state, even with network partitions or service failures. From what I understand, this involves leader election, log replication, and handling split-brain scenarios.

If I needed to implement this in a real project, I would:
1. Research proven algorithms like Raft, which seems more understandable than Paxos
2. Look into existing libraries rather than implementing from scratch - something like etcd for Go or similar for Node.js
3. Start with a simple use case like configuration management before tackling complex state
4. Implement comprehensive testing for network partition scenarios

In my current projects, I've used Redis for distributed locking and PostgreSQL for ACID guarantees, but I recognize those don't solve the full distributed consensus problem.

Could you share more about the specific use case? That might help me think through the requirements more concretely."
```

### When Asked to Optimize Your Solution

**Interviewer**: "Your solution works, but can you optimize it for better performance?"

**Optimization Response**:
```
"Let me analyze the current solution for optimization opportunities.

Looking at my code, I can see a few areas for improvement:

1. **Time Complexity**: My current solution is O(n²) because of the nested loop. I can optimize this to O(n) by using a hash map to store values we've seen instead of searching through the array repeatedly.

2. **Space Complexity**: I can optimize memory usage by [specific technique based on problem].

3. **Early Termination**: I can add conditions to exit early when we find our answer instead of processing all elements.

Let me rewrite this with the optimizations:
[Show improved code]

Now the time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(k) where k is [specific to problem].

For an even more advanced optimization, if the input has specific properties like being sorted, I could use [specific technique] to achieve [better complexity].

Is there a particular aspect of performance you'd like me to focus on - time, space, or readability?"
```

## Script 6: Closing the Interview

### When Asked About Questions

**Interviewer**: "Do you have any questions for me?"

**Strategic Questions to Ask**:
```
"Yes, I have a few questions about the role and team:

1. **Technical Growth**: What are the most interesting technical challenges the team is currently working on? What technologies or systems would I have the opportunity to learn?

2. **Team Dynamics**: How does the team collaborate on projects? What's the code review process like?
