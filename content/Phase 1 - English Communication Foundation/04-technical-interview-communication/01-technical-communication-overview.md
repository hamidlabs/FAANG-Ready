## üíª CODING INTERVIEW COMMUNICATION

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Setup
**Template for Starting Any Coding Problem:**

```
STEP 1: CLARIFY THE PROBLEM (60 seconds)
"Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly..."

Essential Questions Framework:
‚úì "What are the expected input and output formats?"
‚úì "Are there any constraints on input size or values?"
‚úì "Should I handle edge cases like empty input or null values?"
‚úì "What's the expected time/space complexity?"
‚úì "Can I use additional data structures, or are there restrictions?"

STEP 2: CONFIRM WITH EXAMPLES (30 seconds)
"Let me work through a quick example to verify my understanding..."

Example Walkthrough Pattern:
‚úì "If the input is [simple example], then the output should be [expected result]"
‚úì "And for an edge case like [edge example], I'd expect [edge result]"
‚úì "Does that match your expectations?"

STEP 3: ANNOUNCE YOUR APPROACH (45 seconds)
"I see a few ways to approach this problem..."

Approach Communication Pattern:
‚úì "I could use [approach 1] which would be O([complexity]) time..."
‚úì "Or I could use [approach 2] which would be more space-efficient..."
‚úì "I think [chosen approach] is optimal because [reasoning]"
‚úì "Does this approach sound good, or would you prefer to see a different strategy?"
```

### Phase 2: Solution Implementation Communication

‚úì "In the first iteration, we [action] because [condition]..."
‚úì "After [step], our state is [current values]..."
‚úì "The final result is [output], which matches our expected [expected result]"

EDGE CASE VERIFICATION:
‚úì "Let me check edge cases like [scenario]..."
‚úì "For empty input, the code returns [result] which is correct because..."
‚úì "For maximum input size, this should still work because [reasoning]..."

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS COMMUNICATION:
‚úì "The time complexity is O([complexity]) because we [explanation]..."
‚úì "Space complexity is O([complexity]) due to [data structure usage]..."
‚úì "We visit each element once, so it's linear time..."
‚úì "The space is constant except for [specific usage]..."
```

### Phase 4: Optimization Discussion
**How to Discuss Improvements:**

```
OPTIMIZATION COMMUNICATION:
"This solution works correctly, but let me consider if we can optimize it..."

Optimization Framework:
‚úì "The current bottleneck is [specific operation] which takes O([complexity])..."
‚úì "We could improve this by using [technique/data structure] instead..."
