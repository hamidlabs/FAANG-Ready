# Progress Tracking System

## Why Track Progress?

**Without tracking:**
- No sense of accomplishment
- Can't see improvement
- Easy to give up when feeling stuck
- No data to optimize your approach

**With tracking:**
- Visual proof of consistency
- Dopamine from small wins
- Clear data on what works
- Motivation to continue streak
